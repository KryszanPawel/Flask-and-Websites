Project is part of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022.
During this project I have learnt a lot about using bootstrap, flask and jinja.
Website is rendered on flask server, it is styled with bootstrap framework and it works with jinja templates. 
Header and footer on every site are imported by jinja and posts are automaticli redered by jinja for loop and request module. Script is  downloading posts from npoint API and render them on main website. 
Full content of post is accesable by clicking on header. Script moves to template site "post.html" where full post is rendered on based on id of clicked title.
Blog has fully functional navigation bar, sticked to top of website.
